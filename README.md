# discord-audio-bot

## What am I building here?
  
So one of the things that I have an interest is bots. I've seen them in chat rooms ever since the IRC days. They were always the most helpful things in a chat 
room. I want to do a project which is going to use the Discord bot API and have it play audio for the guests in your channel. I frequent a few discord channels 
and in the application they have this "Voice Channel" chat room. Within this voice channel you can speak and visually be able to turn on your camera and see 
the participants. In a discord channel a bot can be in a room and they will be able to take commands from the chat thread. I would love to design a logic 
for interacting with this bot and the many sounds it can play. I feel like this would be a cool thing in a chat room, do you want to play some music...... 
just tell the discord bot. Do you wanna play a short sound effect when someone says something silly in your discord....... tell the discord bot. I want the admin
of the bot to be able handle adding mp3 files or whatever sound clips they want to the bot's "Music list" or something. 

## What technologies are going to build this thing?

I'm thinking of having my express backend, which will be spinned up to house my bot and it's logic. I feel like I'm going to need some sort of place to house my mp3
files for the bot(cloud API or local mp3 library).... I may also need a front end to have the admin control which sounds the bot can play.... I may use React or
some front end library. The MVP should be us being able to type in the Discord chat and having the sound / music played into the channel.
